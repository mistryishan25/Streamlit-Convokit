There's general FAQ below, but if you have any other questions feel free to leave them here!\n\n**Housing FAQ**\n\n* ***I have [insert time slot here] time slot in the general housing lottery, will I be able to get onto West Campus?***\n\nI'll start by saying that there is a new housing lottery system this year that was created in order to mitigate the issue of West Campus filling really quickly, so no one really knows how quickly West Campus will fill. Having said that, West Campus has historically been fill within the first two hours of the lottery. With the new system, I would imagine that would be extended by another 2 hours at most, but if you have a time slot on the second day, your chances are low. \n\n* ***But housing is guaranteed for sophomores? How can they run out?***\n\nHousing is guaranteed for sophomores, but West Campus is not the only housing offered. North Campus and the Collegetown residence halls (Cascadilla, Sheldon Court, and Schyler House) are all open as well, and often have empty beds through the fourth and fifth days of the housing lottery. If you want to live in Cornell housing, you will have that option. \n\n* ***What if I want to move off campus? Is it too late to find an apartment?*** \n\nMoving off campus is definitely an option, and it is not too late to find an apartment. Start by checking the Housing Facebook group (subgroup of the Cornell Facebook group) to see if anyone is looking to sublet a room or a bed next year, as sublets tend to be cheaper. If you don't find anything you like there, Googling \"Cornell Apartments\" will give you a pretty comprehensive list of places that still have rooms and beds open. Additionally, ask around!

{"id": "31cxog", "conversation_id": "31cxog", "text": "Ok everyone. You might have heard bad things about the weather, have experienced northern cold once or twice, or you might just question \"how bad could it be?\" Here's the answer you're looking for. I'll try to give you the actual numbers, the intuition of how cold works and how to fight it, and recommendation and rules for buying clothes.\n\n**1) [Click Here For the Weather Data](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=weather+in+14850+in+2014)** (you can change the 14850 to your zip code to compare.)\n\n**2) Here is my commentary on the weather data:** Cornell weather is not that bad for most people along the northern border of the U.S. It can get down to -10 F (last year it hit -17) but there are only a few weeks when you're below 10 degrees F. Windchill a little worse. Cornell is in a flat section of the state and that means lots of wind, but not as much as any costal town or city. This means windchill can be a factor. At the end of the day, anyone from NYC or Chicago would be fine at Cornell. Cornell only gets such a bad name because it has a big campus and attracts many students from far away who are woefully unprepared.\n\n**3) Here is my description of how cold weather works:** I think this is important. Numbers are meaningless without the ability to interpret them. I know the idea of sub-zero is foreign to some, but truthfully, it just means more layers. I'm not going to go off on a talk about air pockets. Instead let me talk about what it takes to feel comfortable, to feel warm. First, no individual body part can be cold. Second, the body cannot feel its core temperature dropping.\n\nOk, what this means is if any part of your body is exposed to cold objects that *conduct heat* away from you body quickly then that body part is going to feel cold. Things such as carrying books without gloves, walking in thin shoes (*especially* if they're wet, oh god water is a good conductor of heat), or wind on exposed skin will suck the heat from those parts of the body. This makes them feel cold. What that means for you is three things: boots, gloves, hat.\n\nBut here's the truth about all of this: you are a big bag of circulating water. Your body is more than happy to just throw heat at your hands to keep the tissue at normal temperature. It's more than capable of it as well. The problem is that when your body feels its core temperature dropping it panics and constricts blood flow to your extremities. It is willing to sacrifice some heat in the hands (or feet, or nose) to try to conserve as much heat in the torso as possible. This means the hands get cold and causes pain. A lot of times you'll see someone with gloves on talking about how cold their hands are, cursing the gloves, while someone right next to them isn't wearing gloves and feels fine. The difference is that person has warmer clothes around their legs and torso, and that means the body has excess heat to throw at the hands. Another big things that make a difference is movement/exercise. Walking in the sun vs sitting in the shade can be the difference of 15 to 20 degrees.\n\nTry this experiment sometime. Pick up an ice cube. That is literally all you have to do. Roll it around in your hand and feel how it doesn't make your hands hurt. That is because\u2014and I'm going to get kinda patriotic in a \"the human body is awesome\" kind of way\u2014that little piece of crystalized H20 does't have *crap* on the thousands of miles of intricate water circulation system dedicated to keeping that patch of tissue exactly the temperature it should be at. If you can make your torso *hot*, then only 10 degrees or below weather *with* a windchill will be strong enough cause real discomfort to exposed skin.\n\n**4) Here is a discussion on clothes:** Truth be told, this question is better answered in terms of what you need to wear. If you are prepared, you feel the same in the dead of winter at Cornell as you do in fall at Texas, just with more clothes on. As the Swedes say: \"there is no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing.\" This does not mean you need to spend a lot on clothes. There are a lot of ways to design a warm winter wardrobe, but here are some of the basics.\n\nFirst, there are three different kinds of layers: the wicking layer, the warmth layer, and the weather layer. Wicking is just what goes on your skin or near it. It should be breathable and *wick* (pull) moisture (such as sweat) away from your skin. I really don't pay attention to this. I'm a Boy Scout so on weekend long campouts it's important, otherwise t-shirt and underwear is fine. Second is warmth. This can be a fancy parka or jacket, or just a sweater (for the legs it is long underwear). Third is weather, and this means wind and water protection. You do not want water or wind pulling heat directly from your torso! When implemented it looks like this: underwear, t-shirt, winter jacket. The winter jacket has both warm and weather built into one. If you need more warmth, add a sweater, then long underwear, then another sweater.\n\nOther things to think about:\n\n* You have to be careful about being able to take off layers. Too much and you'll be too warm inside. That's why I have a few different jackets depending on the weather, because ideally you want to be able to take off only your outside layer and be cool enough indoors. I avoid long underwear because of this (if I can). I have a light jacket for fall and a heavy parka for winter, that I can unzip if I'm too hot and take off once inside.\n\n* Boots are a big one when snow hits. They prevent wet (and thus, cold) feet.\n\n* Face masks are great for the worst months. I really recommend a balaclava hood. It is a scarf and hat in one, with a face mask that can be pulled up to cover the nose and mouth. If you wear glasses make sure you get one that has holes/thin fabric in front of the mouth to prevent it from fogging up.\n\n* I highly recommend any gloves you get have a wind blocking layer. Otherwise they are basically just swiss cheese. Sure they're warm in still air, but add a breeze and they might as well be in your pocket.\n\n* Cotton and wool are warmer than most synthetic material, so if you are looking for a hoodie or sweater as an intermediary pick those when in doubt. Note: they suck with wind resistance without other fibers mixed in or special treatments. Coats are often measured in a goose down number. I never understood the details, but basically it means the coat is as warm as a certain packing of goose feathers. You will see \"goose down 600\". The higher the number, the warmer, on a roughly linear scale.\n\n**5) Specific clothes to buy:** For the benefit of people who've never shopped cold weather gear before, I'll post some specific products and links. For the most part, I'm posting frugal buys that will get you through the rough of winter. Feel free to dismiss items that don't appeal to you, this is only a set of examples.\n\n* LLBean is a great company IMHO that has tremendous warranties, prices, customer support, and everything from them is machine washable. Click [here](http://www.llbean.com/llb/search/?freeText=winter+jacket&amp;init=1) for some of their jackets. I would recommend a Jacket that goes down to -25 degrees F from them (because you don't want to have to rely on wearing long underwear and a sweater, as they assume with those ratings). My fav is the [Weather Challenger 3-in-1 Jacket](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/83559?feat=3%20in%201-SR0&amp;page=weather-challenger-3-in-1-jacket).\n\n* Other options for coats on a budget are surplus military stock. They have no military markings, are made to be stylus in a plan way, durable, and very functional.

I've been to a frat party almost every week I've been here, and I've noticed so many things here. Seeing 4 ambulances outside my residence hall this night is what motivated me to write this. \n\nDrinking is like machinery here. People all around me go out on the weekends, no matter how much work they have, if they've been invited somewhere or not, etc. The weekend is time to drink and that's unchangable. You pregame at X o clock, catch the bus at Y, go to the party for Z, etc. Every weekend I see almost everyone on my floor do this. I see crowds of dozens of people all going to CTown or west campus or wherever they can get some booze. \n\nAt the parties themselves, people all are just trying to get a beer or whatever alcohol they can lay their hands on. It's honestly just depressing. Everyone complains that the beer is so bad, yet they keep drinking. Do they really need to be drunk that badly? \n\nI hear endless stories of girls that can't wait to go out and then those same girls getting assaulted at night or making a decision they regret. But they go and do it again the next weekend.\n\nI hear guys stressing about how hard it is for them to find a ratio that works and how annoying and douchey the frat guys are. But they go and do it again the next weekend.\n\nKids with so much potential are drinking themselves to a point of injury (I've seen so many ambulances show up to different dorms or houses). But they go and go it again the next weekend.\n\nWhy? I wish I knew. I'll admit why I go: peer pressure. Everyone is going out and I feel left out if I don't. I went out again this weekend, and hated it. I didn't even drink. But can Ivy League students really not find any other way to have fun during the weekends? Does everyone who drinks think that since they had a hard week they need to alter their reality for a couple of hours to relax?\n\nI wanted to get your guys' opinions on the matter.

I lived in Mews my freshman year, then spent 3 years in Low Rises as an RA. I chose to say in LR6/7 each year because I thought it was a good place to live.\n\nI saw three years of residents, across the building, who made good friends with each other, with their roommates, suitemates, and hallmates. They got brunch together, signed leases together, blocked together on West, studied together, gamed together, made brownies together, and did everything together.

You might miss A/C for a month at the beginning and end of the year (the main lounges now have A/C though). Your rooms are actually probably bigger than the new dorms - especially if you're in a double. My Mews double had maybe a yard or so between the beds; the doubles in LR6/7 have enough space for a few extra chairs to hang out or to do pushups or whatever.\n\nYes, you are a little further from central campus. It's not much further than something like Townhouses or High Rise 5, and you have a bus stop right outside the back door, if you don't feel like walking.

West was excellent in small doses as a freshman, but it's become boring ever since then. Appel/RPCC never appealed to me in the first place; they served to tide me over before a late-night ramen cup or Nasties meal.\n\nNot that I treat Cornell's food with any disdain; as I'd told my friend, the fact that I think it's \"okay\" after all this time is saying something.

They tasted flat and substanceless, and didn't even have the decency to come with a throwaway side-salad like Martha's quesadillas did.  \n\nNow they are (comparatively) amazing, with big chunks of chicken and real onions and peppers.  They beat Martha's quesadillas easily.  Too bad each one takes like an hour to cook.\n\nAlso, the salads at the Big Red Barn (yeah, undergrads can go there, it's not just for us grads - to the chagrin of some of the grad students) are giant, heaping things.  And they're not filled with some shitty iceberg lettuce, either.  Lots of romaine and endives, plus a hearty amount of flavorful toppings.  I'm very partial to the chicken souvlaki, because you get a ton of chicken, feta, and olives.  I find they tend to put on a bit too much dressing (and the pita at the bottom gets soaked), but you can ask them to only put in half the normal amount.\n\nThe spinners at Martha's used to be better - when I started grad school four years ago, they were exclusively done by someone we would end up calling \"the spinner lady\" (she'd also call out \"chicken spinner!  chickennnn spinnnnner!\" very idiosyncratically) and had a lot of crunched up tortilla chips inside.

Not to throw a wet blanket on your dreams, but I don't think you'll find much of a niche.  Ithaca Bakery/Collegetown Bagels captures a chunk of the coffee market because they also have great food, Gimme! captures another chunk for the purely-coffee crowd, and there are numerous other small coffee houses around the town.  I would not recommend opening a new one, I've seen too many come and go.\n\nNow, as for the videogame/TCG/board game aspect, it depends how you go about it.  There used to be a place called Play (basically a videogame lounge) where Pixel is now.  That place only survived as long as it did by virtue of myself and a few other high school students spending ungodly amounts of time playing LANned Halo on the original Xbox.  The college student market was non-existent, despite the convenient location right in Collegetown.  Unsurprisingly, the place couldn't survive on the townie market alone.  I think it'd be incredibly difficult to draw any of the student population off-campus for video games when nowadays they can just LAN in the dorms/buildings, or just play online.\n\nOn that note, Pixel has only survived as long as it has because it serves alcohol, but you haven't mentioned serving alcohol at all.  \n\nI was out of my TCG phase by the time Enchanted Badger opened, so I can only comment on Comics for Collectors, but they've got a solid and loyal customer base just based on longevity, so it'd be difficult to pry anyone (townies in particular) away from there for game nights/competitions - at least not for an extended period of time.  As for students, I'm not sure where they go, but there are numerous TCG clubs on campus that meet to play, so you'd probably be hard-pressed to divert that action towards your store - it's free and convenient to meet on campus, and the allure of mere coffee wouldn't be enough to get people to go off-campus.\n\nNow, take all this with a grain of salt, but in my experience (over 15 years in Ithaca) you'd have a very, very hard time generating enough business beyond the initial couple weeks.  Once the novelty wears off, you aren't really offering enough or something new to attract and sustain a solid customer base.  On top of that, any non-alcohol or food-related business that relies on student business is going to inherently be risky - the down times of the summer are very difficult to survive unless you have a big townie customer base built up, and as I've detailed above, I think you'd be in an even worse position to take that business than you would to get student business.", "speaker": "AngryPurpleTeddyBear", "meta": {"score": 13, "top_level_comment": "c9x7ht0", "retrieved_on": 1431220215, "gilded": 0, "subreddit": "Cornell", "stickied": false, "permalink": "", "author_flair_text": "", "node_label": "Agreement", "edge_label": "Asking", "keep_node": true}, "reply-to": "1e5wc2", "timestamp": 1368351067, "vectors": []}

{"id": "c9yzsl0", "conversation_id": "1e5wc2", "text": "Awesome, thank you!\n\nI know I sound like a broken record, but I really can't stress enough how hard it would be to stay in business with just your initial proposal.  I would hate to see someone open up shop only to have to close down 9 months later after hemorrhaging money to stay afloat.\n\nAs you've cottoned onto, one of your best bets to generate business is to have a liquor license.  Even places like CTB turn into bars at night.  A couple places have combined video games with liquor (Pixel, Silky Jones) but I don't think any have combined liquor with TCG or board games (Silky had a couple board games available, but we only played Apples to Apples as offensively as possible - having Cards Against Humanity available would be quite appealing to the drunk crowd).\n\nA couple things I'll say re: alcohol - if your space isn't on the Commons or near/in Collegetown, it'll be very hard to generate business.  Most of Cornell goes to Collegetown, and most of IC goes to the Commons.  The few bars that survive outside those two areas are either very specific in their purpose (Uncle Joe's is the best sportsbar in town since Benchwarmer's closed) or they're attached to a good restaurant (Glenwood Pines, Boatyard Grill, anything on Rte. 13).  Unfortunately, this leads you into the common trap for Ithaca businesses geared towards young people - the best way to generate business is to be in either Collegetown or the Commons, but the rent is vicious, so if you don't make enough during the school year to survive the summer, you're well and truly boned.\n\nNow, that being said, I'd recommend that you do a pub crawl around Ithaca sometime and take notes of what each place offers.  I don't live in Ithaca anymore and when I do return I only frequent a few places, so things have probably changed a little bit from what I'm telling you.  Use these notes to determine whether you're actually going to be offering something substantially different enough to capture your own niche market.\n\nFinally, no matter what you do, if you're planning on serving booze, SERVE FOOD.  You'll already have the capabilities for at least some food service if you're planning on being a coffee shop during the day, and if you offer food to the drunks, you keep their business rather than shuffling them off to any of the late-night pizza places.  (Case in point - I'll drink at Bandwagon just for the fries...YUM).  If you can develop a specialty drunk food that's cheap and easy for you to churn out, you'll retain business and keep the people drinking at your place.  One of the common concerns for drunk college kids in Ithaca is getting drunk food, and the main options are pizza, DP Dough (calzones), or Hot Truck/Louie's Lunch.  By offering something different or original, you can separate yourself from the pack.\n\nHope all this helps!  Good luck if you do decide to open a place, I'll be sure to check it out next time I'm back in Ithaca.", "speaker": "AngryPurpleTeddyBear", "meta": {"score": 3, "top_level_comment": "c9x7ht0", "retrieved_on": 1431154278, "gilded": 0, "subreddit": "Cornell", "stickied": false, "permalink": "", "author_flair_text": "", "node_label": "Agreement", "edge_label": "Asking", "keep_node": true}, "reply-to": "c9yzdfr", "timestamp": 1368585763, "vectors": []}

I recall that the campus \"poles\" with a direct speaker-phone to campus security was installed in 1986 or so, and there were clear messages to everyone that they were free to press the button for any reason -- better safe than sorry.  There was also a campus volunteer group formed around that time that would walk anyone home (or wherever) at night, no questions asked.  And there were monthly \"Take Back the Night\" marches.

Larger if you consider AEP too.  I don't think any of the undergrads I know felt lost or alienated within it though - I think almost all of the professors are very approachable and care about their students.\n\nYour gen-ed classes will probably be large-ish, but your physics major lectures should be somewhere in the 30-50-student range.   But your discussion sections (usually taught by grad student TAs) will probably be in the ~20-student range.  And there's always office hours where you can really get face-to-face attention from professors and TAs.\n\nIf you have some physics (especially AP physics) experience from high school, you'll probably want to take the Honors intro physics series of courses your freshman year.  They're much much smaller than the intro physics series for engineers (which gets to ~400+ students) and they go over the material in depth, with more formalism, and even cover some cooler topics like special relativity.\n\n&gt;What's your relationship with the professors like?\n\nWell, I was a grad student, so by my age I had gotten used to approaching professors and talking to them without being too intimidated.  The ones I've had the pleasure to research and teach with were nice and helpful.  Some of them are easier to crack jokes with than others.

{"id": "cq0duyg", "conversation_id": "318v39", "text": "**Ok, here's the answer you're looking for:**\n\n(I'm actually just going to post this directly to /r/Cornell now that I see how big it has become)\n\n**1) [Click Here For the Data](https://www.wolframalpha.com/input/?i=weather+in+14850+in+2014)** (you can change the 14850 to your zip code to compare.)\n\n**2) Here is my commentary on the data:** Cornell weather is not that bad for most people along the northern border of the U.S. It can get down to -10 F (last year it hit -17) but there are only a few weeks when you're below 10 degrees F. Windchill a little worse. Cornell is in a flat section of the state and that means lots of wind, but not as much as any costal town or city. This means windchill can be a factor. At the end of the day, anyone from NYC or Chicago would be fine at Cornell. Cornell only gets such a bad name because it has a big campus and attracts many students from far away who are woefully unprepared.\n\n**3) Here is my description of how cold weather works:** I think this is important. Numbers are meaningless without the ability to interpret them. You are from Texas, I see. I know the idea of sub-zero is foreign, but truthfully, it just means more layers. I'm not going to go off on talk about air pockets. Instead let me talk about what it takes to feel comfortable, to feel warm. First, no individual body part can be cold. Second, the body cannot feel its core temperature dropping.\n\nOk, what this means is if any part of your body is exposed to cold objects that *conduct heat* away from you body quickly then that body part is going to feel cold. Things such as carrying books without gloves, walking in thin shoes (*especially* if they're wet, oh god water is a good conductor of heat), or wind on exposed skin will suck the heat from those parts of the body. This makes them feel cold. What that means for you is three things: boots, gloves, hat.\n\nBut here's the truth about all of this: you are a big bag of circulating water. Your body is more than happy to just throw heat at your hands to keep the tissue at normal temperature. It's more than capable of it as well. The problem is that when your body feels its core temperature dropping it panics and constricts blood flow to your extremities. It is willing to sacrifice some heat in the hands (or feet, or nose) to try to conserve as much heat in the torso as possible. This means the hands get cold and causes pain. A lot of times you'll see someone with gloves on talking about how cold their hands are, cursing the gloves, while someone right next to them isn't wearing gloves and feels fine. The difference is that person has warmer clothes around their legs and torso, and that means the body has excess heat to throw at the hands.\n\nTry this experiment sometime. Pick up an ice cube. That is literally all you have to do. Roll it around in your hand and feel how it doesn't make your hands hurt. That is because\u2014and I'm going to get kinda patriotic in a \"the human body is awesome\" kind of way\u2014that little piece of crystalized H20 does't have *crap* on the thousands of miles of intricate water circulation system dedicated to keeping that patch of tissue exactly the temperature it should be at. If you can make your torso *hot*, then only 10 degrees or below weather *with* a windchill will be strong enough cause real discomfort to exposed skin.\n\n**4) Here is a discussion on clothes:** Truth be told, this question is better answered in terms of what you need to wear. You feel the same in the dead of winter at Cornell as you do in fall at Texas. As the Swedes say: \"there is no such thing as bad weather, just bad clothing.\" This does not mean you need to spend a lot on clothes. There are a lot of ways to design a warm winter wardrobe, but here are some of the basics.\n\nFirst, there are three different kinds of layers: the wicking layer, the warmth layer, and the weather layer. Wicking is just what goes on your skin or near it. It should be breathable and *wick* (pull) moisture (such as sweat) away from your skin. I really don't pay attention to this. I'm a Boy Scout so on weekend long campouts it's important, otherwise t-shirt and underwear is fine. Second is warmth. This can be a fancy parka or jacket, or just sweater. Third is weather, and this means wind and water protection. You do not want water or wind pulling heat directly from your torso! When implemented it looks like this: underwear, t-shirt, winter jacket. The winter jacket has both warm and weather built into one. If you need more warmth, add a sweater, then long underwear, then another sweater.\n\nOther things to think about:\n\n* You have to be careful about being able to take off layers. Too much and you'll be too warm inside. That's why I have a few different jackets depending on the weather, because ideally you want to be able to take off only your outside layer and be cool enough indoors. I avoid long underwear because of this (if I can). I have a light jacket for fall and a heavy parka for winter, that I can unzip if I'm too hot and take off once inside.\n\n* Boots are a big one when snow hits. They prevent wet (and thus, cold) feet.\n\n* Face masks are great for the worst months. I really recommend a balaclava hood. It is a scarf and hat in one, with a face mask that can be pulled up to cover the nose and mouth. If you wear glasses make sure you get one that has holes/thin fabric in front of the mouth to prevent it from fogging up.\n\n* I highly recommend any gloves you get have a wind blocking layer. Otherwise they are basically just swiss cheese. Sure they're warm in still air, but add a breeze and they might as well be in your pocket.\n\n* Cotton and wool are warmer than most synthetic material, so if you are looking for a hoodie or sweater as an intermediary pick those when in doubt. Note: they suck with wind resistance without other fibers mixed in or special treatments. Coats are often measured in a goose down number. I never understood the details, but basically it means the coat is as warm as a certain packing of goose feathers. You will see \"goose down 600\". The higher the number, the warmer, on a roughly linear scale.\n\n**5) Specific clothes to buy:** For the benefit of people who've never shopped cold weather gear before, I'll post some specific products and links. For the most part, I'm posting frugal buys that will get you through the rough of winter. Feel free to dismiss items that don't appeal to you, this is only a set of examples.\n\n* LLBean is a great company IMHO that has tremendous warranties, prices, and customer support. Click [here](http://www.llbean.com/llb/search/?freeText=winter+jacket&amp;init=1) for some of their jackets. I would recommend a Jacket that goes down to -25 degrees F from them (because you don't want to have to rely on wearing long underwear and a sweater, as they assume with those ratings). My fav is the [Weather Challenger 3-in-1 Jacket](http://www.llbean.com/llb/shop/83559?feat=3%20in%201-SR0&amp;page=weather-challenger-3-in-1-jacket).\n\n* Other options for coats on a budget are surplus military stock. They have no military markings, are made to be stylus in a plan way, durable, and very functional. Two example sites are [Army Surplus World](http://www.armysurplusworld.com/display.asp?subDepartmentID=276) and [Army Navy Outfitters](http://www.armynavydeals.com/asp/Default.asp?). Crappy websites but good products.\n\n* You want a good pair of warm walking boots. Mickey Mouse boots are a name given to a particular type of boots used by the U.S. military. They often have ugly yellow text on them, but that's only if you look at them up close and for as cheap as $20 from [here](http://stores.alleghenywholesale.com/usgi-military-bata-black-mickey-mouse-boots-w-valve-20f-brand-new/) they deserve a mention.\n\n* [These gloves](http://www.mechanix.com/cold-weather). They are a little annoying because of the logo, but Mechanix Wear makes the most functional gloves out there. Just the $10 [Thermal Knit](http://www.mechanix.com/cold-weather/thermal-knit) will do you well.\n\n* If you don't wear glasses, but [this](http://www.amazon.com/Chaos--CTR-Chinook-Balaclava-Windproof/dp/B002ZG7RFI/ref=sr_1_3?ie=UTF8&amp;qid=1428097222&amp;sr=8-3&amp;keywords=balaclava) baraclava for $20.

That said, some of the core courses (3110 and 3410) have a *lot* of work and can definitely be a pain, but they're totally manageable.\n\nI'm not sure if that helps, I can probably go into more detail if you'd like but I think the bottom line is with some (not even that much) time management, you'll find that you have enough free time to manage your extracurriculars and social life. I graduated a semester early and was still part of a club team that had practice around 10 hours a week and was on the executive board of a non-profit, but I also took probably close to the bare minimum of CS courses.

That's without even bringing up what I heard about sexual harassment and assault, which I hear is pretty common in those situations in American colleges, people being medically evacuated to hospitals and so on. \n\nTo be honest, if I compare this place to my undergrad institution overseas, you'd never be able to party so hard there, simply because you'd fail every course.The following is relevant to engineering and sciences, I cannot speak for other majors. The freshmen and sophomore courses are easier here, the workload is lesser, the exams are easier. So you pay 60k a year to get an education that is not as good as what you'd get overseas for maybe 5k a year, because the university does not push you that hard in the first couple of years. It has become a standard to let the students have enough free time to waste on partying because here the students are clients and their will must be met. The students want to party, get drunk and make questionable decisions? Sure, let them, they pay so much, they should be able to do whatever they want.", "speaker": "manVsPhD", "meta": {"score": -3, "top_level_comment": "d8uoxes", "retrieved_on": 1478660264, "gilded": 0, "subreddit": "Cornell", "stickied": false, "permalink": "", "author_flair_text": ""}, "reply-to": "d8va44o", "timestamp": 1476677421, "vectors": []}

{"id": "d8vib8r", "conversation_id": "57qqhb", "text": "I'm not sure I'm able to express the extent that this strikes a chord with me. Freshman year I went out with my friends every weekend (in massive groups of sometimes 30 floor mates), and spent the last 45 minutes of every night collecting those that were worse for wear. I didn't drink (still enjoyed myself for the most part; most parties had a dance floor and that entertaining enough for a few hours), and it quickly became painfully obvious how these incredibly motivated, driven, intelligent people simply didn't know how to take care of themselves. And I don't mean everyone, not by a long shot, but it was more than once that I alone stayed with a stayed up with a vomiting floor mate, or rolled them onto their side, or stopped another peer from trying to feed them or give them more to drink or give them coffee or send them home alone.\n\nIn fact, for anyone interested effecting legitimate change on Cornell's campus with regards to drinking culture, I heavily suggest you check out [Cayuga's Watchers](http://cayugaswatchers.org). It's an educational non-profit, run entirely by Cornell students and dedicated to mitigating the dangers of high-risk alcohol consumption. It's not about sobriety or killing parties, it's about knowing how to take care of yourself and your peers when shit hits the fan.\n\nAnyway, the advice I wish someone had given me when I was in your position is: use this time to find a group of people that spend their weekends how you'd want to spend them. Might be sports (shoutout to Cornell Sport Tae Kwon Do), traveling, playing video games, watching movies, activism, or any number of other things. Cornell is a HUGE school, don't let yourself be pigeon-holed; there's always someone else who shares your interests.\n\nI honestly didn't find the people that I really wanted to be around (recreational athletes and student activists) until senior year. I spent freshman year trying to connect with the legitimately interesting and fun people I shared a floor with, sophomore year struggling to deal with the fact that I had completely lost touch with those people, and junior year essentially starting all over building the relationships that I should have built in the first place.\n\nThe group psychology involved in college drinking culture is so preposterously complex that I spent the better part of my college career literally working upwards of 40 hours a week to understand it and I barely have a grasp on it. Again, if you want to learn more, check out Cayuga's Watchers (or hit me up, I was their president for a while and am currently on their Board of Directors).

There are too many people around you to ever feel stuck; every new person you meet has potential to be a close friend.

{"id": "descm2v", "conversation_id": "5yioo5", "text": "Ehhhh let's not generalize. I lived in Ithaca 2010-2014 and every Slope Day announcement was a huge bummer. If you look at the past decade or so of lineups, or just your comment for that matter, for some reason the Slope Day Board thinks filling the lineups with rappers is the way to go and it just makes little sense to me.\nIt's not that I dislike hip-hop either, it's just...is a rapper with a backing track really the wide-appeal party music for a daytime outdoor festival? \n\nKanye played in 2004, no one knew who he was, so it's a bit unfair to use him as a shining example of good choice (was his set even good back then?).\nSnoop Dogg played in 2005 (and The Game sub-headlined) and I can admit that's a good headliner to get. Snoop Dogg is a perfect wide-appeal fun act to get, bravo to them.\n2006 they switched it up and Ben Folds headlined, with Talib Kweli underneath. Interesting choice but I can respect it nonetheless.\n\n2007 - T.I.. Alright here signals the start of the mainstream radio rap era of headliners. TV on the Radio also played which is truly impressive. They are phenomenal both on record and especially live.\n\n2008 - Ted Leo, Gym Class Heroes, Hot Hot Heat. Now assuming that 2008's Cornell community has the same shitty musical tastes as it did in the 2010s, I bet people freaked out (positively) over Gym Class Heroes but had no idea who Ted Leo was.\n\n2009 - Pussycat Dolls? Asher Roth? Is this where we can say things started to go downhill, because I would agree.\n\n2010 - Drake - yeah, I get it he's a superstar. Dull mainstream hip-hop nonetheless.\n\n2011 - Nelly, Ra Ra Riot, The Cool Kids (a rap group). Now, I was psyched for Ra Ra Riot, who put on an awesome set but Nelly? Alright, cool I guess for that nostalgia factor, but he was pretty terrible.\n\n2012 - Taio Cruz, Neon Trees, The Wailers - possibly the worst headliner in their history. Neon Trees put on a good set and The Wailers were straight up reggae-jamming which was PERFECT for Slope Day. Taio Cruz was absolute trash.\n\n2013 - Kendrick, Hoodie Allen (another rapper), and 5 &amp; a Dime. So we finally have some DANCE music making an appearance in an obscure DJ set, and of course two more rappers. At this point Kendrick was just beginning to get big and many did not know who he was. He played a pretty standard rap set, nothing too fancy. I saw him headline a festival last year with a full band - fucking epic. Again though, it's hard to jam out to subdued hip-hop beats with unintelligible vocals (at Slope Day).\nAnd then the next year came...\n\n2014 - Ludacris. ooooo boy. another trash set. Matt and Kim of course are gold live and thank god to Binghamton for booking them, otherwise we wouldn't have gotten them in our area. 3lau, again thankfully they included an actual dance act so that people could, you know, dance.\n\nSo I was only at the 2011-2014 iterations, and I know Chance the Rapper (2015) is a great pick so no argument there despite his rapper status. Magic (the band) I'm assuming weren't too good since they're one-hit wonders.\n\nSo if Chance/Matt and Kim/3lau all are respectable choices in your eyes, you basically disliked 2016 and this new lineup then? I don't like the 2016 lineup either though Walk the Moon is very popular and I bet many were pleased with that choice at least.\n\nBut how can you mention 3lau and not be psyched for Big Gigantic? Are you just unfamiliar? Everyone in the electronic dance scene knows Big Gigantic and his spectacular live sets. I would have KILLED to see Big Gigantic perform at Slope Day. What a perfect choice. Misterwives looks like an indie-pop band but I'm unfamiliar with them so no judgment there.\n\nI went a little bit too deep into this but I happened to see the reaction to the Slope Day announcement on facebook today and I was just baffled. It was a string of 50+ comments of people who were either shitting on the lineup despite clearly not ever hearing the artists, or completely surprised about how obscure/unknown the acts were.\nLike what do people want, seriously? Another big league rapper? Who else could possibly satisfy the unfortunately narrow tastes of the Cornell students?", "speaker": "justfetus", "meta": {"score": 7, "top_level_comment": "deqwvsg", "retrieved_on": 1491389931, "gilded": 0, "subreddit": "Cornell", "stickied": false, "permalink": "", "author_flair_text": ""}, "reply-to": "derihrs", "timestamp": 1489213882, "vectors": []}

Now those are gone and 90% of the North Campus options are fine-to-great. After freshman year I lived off campus and then boarding in a frat. If you can swing being a boarder, it's a sweet set up. Cheap and with just enough of the greek experience without having to make it your life.\n\nTo list some advantages, I'd start with size. This can be a drawback depending on your personality, you have to seek out the experience that you want, but it also means that whatever it is you want from your time you can find it. It also means there's a relatively massive alumni network.\n\nNatural beauty is a really nice thing to have on hand, but you still have a legit town to take advantage of too.\n\nIn all of my experiences the administration was responsive and helpful. Coming from a family that works in Higher Ed, this should not be undervalued.\n\nI had no trouble finding enjoyable and well paid campus work, even without work study status.\n\nCornell Calves.

{"id": "df2anrj", "conversation_id": "5zz21y", "text": "Oooh. Lots of things!\n\n- First of all, it's a great school and people do respect a Cornell degree. (Enough that when I went to a non-Ivy law school I learned quickly to avoid the question of where I went to undergrad because people reacted like I was Andy Bernard.) You'll work for your degree. That's okay, you'll also learn a whole ton, and not just in your field.\n\n- Another poster mentioned Cornell Calves - they're 100% real. I started running in Ithaca and now I miss the everyday hill training I got there just walking around.\n\n- Tons of cultural activities around. I remember an awesome Persian night with food and music, and a Holi festival every year. Every year on Chinese New Year and Mardi Gras I get homesick for Cornell's dining halls that put on special dinners. I also took a class called \"History of Things\" where we focused on a different object each week and then visited places on campus related to those things -- greenhouses, ceramic display at the Johnson, geology lab, to name a few. \n\n- On that note, there are a lot of really cool courses you can take there, and not just in Arts &amp; Sciences. Pretty much everyone takes Wines their senior year. I filled one of my science class requirements with a class called \"Earthquake!\" and it was all about natural disasters (and was maybe the easiest class I took there, but I still learned a lot). The PE department is also an amazing resource and I wish I'd taken more classes there.\n\n- If you play a sport, there's a pretty good chance you can keep doing it at Cornell even if you're not exceptional, through the varsity teams or through intramurals.\n\n- The Outdoor Education center! The rock climbing wall! (I never used this but they exist and people love them.)\n\n- I have to give a shoutout to the program houses. I lived in JAM (music house) freshman and sophomore year. The program houses host events, so I got to see a lot of free concerts there. Risley, the art house, looks like Hogwarts and also hosts an artist in residence. 100% recommend looking at program houses if any suit your interests. \n\n- It's a big enough school that no matter who you are, there's a friend group for you. \n\n- Ithaca is great and there are lots of things going on. It's not a big city, but it's not a dull place to be when you can get off campus. The farmer's market is awesome, the gorges are worth visiting regularly, there are festivals like Applefest and a chili festival in the Commons every year. The State Theater gets [great shows](http://www.stateofithaca.com/events/) regularly. \n\n- There's nowhere prettier than Upstate NY in October.\n\nOK that's probably more than you were asking for.

{"id": "df3x6cb", "conversation_id": "602wjt", "text": "I transferred from a community college, and I think why they do it is because they're part of the SUNY system. So they're curriculum easily flows between schools. And transfer is far more common for majors that have high attrition. It's really hard to transfer into AEM because everyone stays there. Animal science is significantly easier because half of the freshmen in the program just realize they actually would hate being a vet and changed majors.\n\nThe reason you got in straight out of high school is because you were much less likely to interact with college material and drop out. For every 70,000 we put into Cornell, they put 150,000 into us. There's a net loss on tuition, which is why they dip their toes into so much other funding. If a student drops out they're less likely to see a fat alumni check. But once you've done a couple of years, that risk is gone. Transfers are way less likely to drop out.\n\nAnd yeah, I got some pretty bad grades when I first transferred. But that's not because it was too hard, it was just hard in a weird way. Cornell meets SUNY standards for curriculum for classic physics, chem, and whatever classes. You won't learn much here that you won't at any other school. However, you're more likely to have kids studying absurd amounts, so professors add harder questions so everyone can get a 55 and they can curve it up to a B+. At my last school the questions were more straightforward and didn't rely on curves. If you studied until you understood the material you could do well. This year I got more comfortable with this system and brought my semester gpa from 2.8 in spring to a 3.7 in fall. So these transfers will probably get a kick in the ass when they see their gpa, party less, figure out the system, and do a lot better.

There are positives and negatives about every school, but here is what I appreciate about Cornell.\n\n1. I remember a poster that mentions that Cornell is an \"elite school\", but it is not \"elitist\". After leaving Cornell and attending Vandy for graduate school, I cannot appreciate this enough. The student body is very diverse, not only in terms of ethnic backgrounds, but also in terms of socio-economic background. I made friends with people from all walks of life. Further, with the current political climate in the U.S., Cornell has come out very strong and definitive language in terms of supporting its international students, even offering legal services through its top-ranked law school.\n\n2. From your other posts, seems like you're considering CS. My friends who were in the CS program got some awesome offers (re: Google, Amazon, Microsoft) for summer internships that eventually turned into full-time positions after they graduate. The CS program is truly world-renowned! \n\n3. If you haven't visited, the campus is a work of beauty. The \"quads\" are great to just walk around and hang out when the weather is nice. There is a good mix of gothic-style buildings mixed with newer buildings, such as the Physics Building and Gates Hall. I will also appreciate the libraries (shout out to Mann!)\n\n4. Number of research opportunities for undergraduates. Cornell ranks #1 in terms of sending students to graduate school. An overwhelming majority of the students I knew conducted some sort of research. \n\n5. The people! Cornell is a large school, but I was able to find \"my family\" and was invited to the homes of Professors for dinner.  \n\n6. The gym facilities. There are 4-5 gyms on campus? \n\n7.

{"id": "e01ykeh", "conversation_id": "8oanmh", "text": "\\(assuming you have the guaranteed transfer like I did, this is my opinion on it\\)\n\nGoing to be totally honest with you\\- I feel like I missed out on a huge part of the Cornell experience. Living on North seems like an awesome way to spend your first year at Cornell, and I feel like everyone I know who's not a transfer is close to a bunch of people they lived with. My old school didn't really have that same kind of \"freshman experience\", and I feel like it's a classic \"college thing\" I missed out on. It was really hard coming here and seeing how everyone seemed to be so close to a group of friends from their freshman year while I struggled to break into a group as an outsider. Transfers tend to stick together in friend groups, which is good but I definitely wish that other people were a little more welcoming to us. Sophomore housing is also much less centralized and it definitely doesn't have the same \"leave\\-your\\-door\\-open\\-and\\-sit\\-in\\-the\\-common\\-room\" vibe of freshman housing, which can feel really isolating as a new student.\n\nGetting research is harder\\- a lot of profs want freshman so they can train them and have someone in their lab for as long as possible, and you'll probably get turned away by at least one or two profs solely because you're a sophomore. I did eventually find a position but my freshman friends had it way easier. This is also similar for some clubs, you basically have one shot your sophomore fall and then they won't want to take you after that semester because you're too old for a new member. Also idk if this is something you're interested in, but I really wish I had a chance to join greek life as a freshman. It's definitely harder to connect with your pledge class if you're a year older than most of them, and it's another thing I just wish I had more time in.\n\nI would have killed to spend my freshman year here. Don't get me wrong\\- I'm glad I transferred in order to at least get three years here, but I definitely feel like I missed out on a lot of the bonding experiences, academic opportunities, and classic \"Cornell moments\" that my non\\-transfer friends had. The little things add up, and it seems really trivial to someone who was here as a freshman, but I'm lowkey sad that I never really ate at RPCC/Appel, never went to Nasties, don't understand the freshman dorm reputations, didn't get to be in the class pic, etc.\n\nTL;DR: transferring is the worst but I've yet to meet someone who regretted doing it. find transfer friends to commiserate with when you're feeling sad about missing out on things, they'll understand", "speaker": "cornellthrowaway20", "meta": {"score": 27, "top_level_comment": "e01ykeh", "retrieved_on": 1532155745, "gilded": 0, "subreddit": "Cornell", "stickied": false, "permalink": "/r/Cornell/comments/8oanmh/what_will_i_miss_out_on_my_freshman_year/e01ykeh/", "author_flair_text": ""}, "reply-to": "8oanmh", "timestamp": 1528053948, "vectors": []}

My comments are mostly geared toward STEM majors, who I personally believe should not struggle to get a B in this course *if they are utilizing the resources available to them.* I'm not sure what argument you can make against that assuming they aren't struggling with the college adjustment. You obviously can attest to the care of the course staff and professors. \n\nWith that said there is no reason students who even essentially know nothing can't get 100s on the projects by going to office hours (see: algo). With this if a student studies reasonably for the exams (again - assuming they aren't getting hammered, too many credits, unlucky exam schedule, sickness etc) I really feel like you should be able to do well in this course.\n\nTrust me, I know how hard it can be. I actually got a B in 1110 myself, yet got A's in OS + Prac and all my grad courses (and am going to grad school now). There are many factors at play when taking a course and what grade you receive in it.

I've seen students do this (and for other courses that I don't staff, besides) plenty of times; it's probably why most students that do badly do badly, at least those who go to office hours frequently.\n\nNormally I'd agree and say this is a separate issue unrelated to the course, but since 1110 is an introductory course I consider the development of the appropriate study skills to be part of learning the course/curriculum. After all, studying for CS stuff can be quite different from say, a biology exam. It does concern me that some students don't really develop efficient studying techniques/use class resources effectively, but that doesn't mean that they're not putting in an effort (even if that effort is misguided).\n\nI agree with your general sentiment though, in that I'm quite confident everyone *could* get a B. It's unfortunate that sometimes Python has a reputation as a really scary introductory course outside of the department, when that's not how it's designed/taught at all. Tough but not a weed out, as Walker's said in the past.\n\nOn an unrelated note, what do you think of OS + Prac's workload? I'm considering taking the practicum for OS next semester, but I'm split between taking 3110 + Algo or OS + Prac + Algo.

C programming teaches you to be very thorough; you develop excellent program analysis skills in addition to learning the C debugger, GDB.\n\nOS Prac has a reputation of being the most difficult project course aside from compilers. I won't say it isn't true. I won't say you won't work extremely hard, and still maybe not get it right. But I will say you will walk away from it so much better than you are now that you won't regret it.\n\nFeel free to PM me if you have more questions.\n\nEdit: To address your question on workload, OS + Prac is very heavy. I would not recommend taking another difficult core course along with it. Algo can be done but you need to be proactive. Prac is 5-6 projects of varying workload - the first two can be done in less than 20 hours if you know what you're doing, but I'd expect to spend quite a bit of time on them as P2 in particular can be tricky. The third is shorter - UDP is not terrible. P4 is TCP, and is notoriously difficult. Many students spend 60+ hours on this project. The last is the filesystem...

Neither is the idea that black people should be considered more racist than white people if they tell them to \"shut up\" in response to racist comments (which is not to say that I think that is the correct response from either side, but that's a larger argument).

{"id": "e0jocnq", "conversation_id": "8qjp29", "text": "As /u/SpookBusters says, the first year of college is generally pretty stressful regardless of your prep work. It comes with a ton of lifestyle changes that can be difficult to which to adapt.\n\nThe best thing you can do is pick up more skills that will help you thrive living independently. I was amazed at the number of students I met in my first year who had never done laundry, cooked a meal, or managed their bank account. I'm not questioning your abilities in adulting, just mentioning how many people I saw affected by their lack of experience. At the same time, a good hobby or three can really help reduce stress in the first year (and make you a more interesting person to be around). Pick a skill you're already pretty good at and master it this summer or spend some time finding a hobby that you'd like to learn in your downtime at school and get a start on it. For example I got really, really good at origami one year because it was something quiet and relaxing between classes. A friend of mine became a really good juggler, later founding a juggling club which oddly enough was an asset during her job search.\n\nLike /u/SpookBusters said, look into some open source projects or oddball programming languages (Prolog comes to mind) if you absolutely must do something CS-y. I'd push you to stay away from an all-CS summer and college, though. You're going to need some things that get you away from the computer and this summer is a great time to set yourself up for them. You risk burning out if you're already trying to teach yourself CS skills so that you can then learn them again in class.

It's far from central, there's no AC so the first and last months suck, and the rooms are small, especially triples (which are forced, i.e converted double). The heating is a little funny sometimes, and you can easily smell weed from the people smoking on the golf course/the low rise fire escapes. Bathrooms aren't gross but they're not great either. And it definitely sucks to walk past all the new dorms on your way back from campus.\n\nThat being said, it's a great place to live overall. It was *excellent* for making friends. Shared trauma or something, lol. But out of the 42 people on our floor, thirty something of us were all friends and did stuff together, hung out in the common room, made jokes about the RA (we had two, actually, one disappeared). It was always easy to find someone to go to dinner with or help you with problem sets. Now, it's possible that your unit might not be sociable, but the majority of units (floors) make it easy to make friends. I still hang out with some of my friends from Low Rise, and about half of us will get dinner together a couple times a semester.\n\nFurthermore- the buildings have some upsides. They're generally quiet, the winding hallways cut off noise for a good percent of the rooms. This also cuts down on any idea of a \"party dorm\" so loud drunk people will be limited to people who live there. As /u/l33tnerd said the doubles are pretty big.

It would've been over a 3.7 if it wasn't for the C I got in Linear Algebra (my only C in college). I also don't really have any extra curricular activities, but I do have some semi-interesting personal projects including a Raycasting engine and a lot of self-taught web development experience. I plan to really try to beef up my portfolio with personal projects this year while I also work full time at Lockheed Martin in Owego, NY. I plan to apply to the program after my first year at Lockheed. I would hopefully continue to work at Lockheed while going to school part time.\n\nI've also gotten pretty close with at least two of my professors so I think that I would be able to get some decent letters of recommendation as well.\n\nAdditionally after looking at the curriculum, Cornell seems to focus on a number of things, the two notable topics for me being Machine Learning and Human Computer Interaction. I actually just took both of these courses during my last semester at UB and earned an A- in both, so perhaps having these classes on my transcript could also give me a leg up.\n\nPlease let me know what you guys think! Also any tips on how to improve my chances over the coming year would be much appreciated.
